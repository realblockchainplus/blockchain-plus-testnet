KEY CONCEPTS:

  - Two types of nodes:
    - Regular Nodes
      - Regular nodes are lightweight nodes, such as web browser and mobile or desktop apps.
        They perform ledger operations, such as sending and receiving.
    - Partner Nodes
      - Partner nodes are Regular Nodes with uptime close to 99.99%.
      - Must have a minimum amount of processing power.
      - Extra tasks: housekeeping, random number teleportation, algorithm generation, config
  - Transactions are carried out by 4 (unconfirmed) nodes: 2 regular, 2 partner
  - New blocks contain only one transaction (?)
  - New blocks are created by the randomly selected partner nodes
  - Transaction fees are split between the randomly selected partner nodes

TRANSACTION FLOW:

Given a network of 5 regular nodes and 5 partner nodes at t = 0:

  regular: [A, B, C, D, E]
  partner: [V, W, X, Y, Z]

  addresses: {
    A: '0x01',
    B: '0x02',
    C: '0x03',
    D: '0x04',
    E: '0x05',
    V: '0x06',
    W: '0x07',
    X: '0x08',
    Y: '0x09',
    Z: '0x10'
  }

  randomNumberSet = new Uint32Array(20);
  generateRandomNumbers = (t) => {
    window.crypto.getRandomValues(randomNumberSet);
  }
  validFor: 30;

  fxConvertRandomNumberToNodeNumber = (isPartner) => {
    let randomNodeAddress = '';
    let randomNumber = randomNumberSet.pop();
    randomNodeAddress += isPartner ? numToPartner(randomNumber) : numToWitness(randomNumber);
    return randomNodeAddress;
  };

  witness1 = fxConvertRandomNumberToNodeNumber(false);
  witness2 = fxConvertRandomNumberToNodeNumber(false);
  partner1 = fxConvertRandomNumberToNodeNumber(true);
  partner2 = fxConvertRandomNumberToNodeNumber(true);

  tx(amount) => {
    txId: 00001,
    from: 0x01,
    amount,
    to: 0x03,
    witness1,
    witness2,
    partner1,
    partner2
  };
